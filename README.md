### Live Demo

https://getlucky3000.netlify.app/

### GitHub

https://github.com/theandrewfulton/getlucky3000

### Installation

#### Using Git:

[Ensure you have Git installed](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

In a terminal instance:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:theandrewfulton/getlucky3000.git
cd getlucky3000
```

Alternatively you can download and extract the [zip file](https://github.com/theandrewfulton/getlucky3000/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Once downloaded and extracted you need to set up a live server in order for the JavaScript file to run correctly. One way to do this is to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Open ```index.html``` in VSCode, right click and select "Open with Live Server".

### APIs

Get Lucky 3000 makes use of the following APIs:

Affirmations: https://www.affirmations.dev/

Corporate BS Generator: https://github.com/sameerkumar18/corporate-bs-generator-api - the Occupation field is a dummy as this API doesn't take any inputs.

Dad Jokes: https://rapidapi.com/KegenGuyll/api/dad-jokes/details

Pictures of Dog Breeds: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

### Issues

The affirmations API returns a CORS error. This has been mitigated by using a proxy however you may need to [activate it](http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo). More information on the problem and ways to mitigate it can be found in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@dtkatz/3-ways-to-fix-the-cors-error-and-how-access-control-allow-origin-works-d97d55946d9).

### Why???

This project was for a Hackathon challenge to test our git collaboration and to help us with learning JavaScript at Coder Academy in Sydney.
